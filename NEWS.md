A three-dimensional Community Velocity Model (CVM) was developed to provide a 
framework for simulating ground motion expected during an earthquake on the 
highly urbanized part of the Wasatch fault zone. The CVM provides researchers a
unified subsurface velocity model to simulate effects including strong motion,
seismicity location, and tomographic velocity. Elements that populate the 
CVM include: soil classes, basin geometry, basin-sediment interfaces, 
crustal tomography, and the Moho.

The Wasatch Front CVM was developed by Harold Magistrale of San Diego State University
and is based on earlier models developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center(SCEC).
The CVM is periodically updated as more data become available and as additional 
analyses of existing data allow improvement to model elements. Important in refining 
the CVM are geophysical and borehole data that enhance our understanding of basin 
structure and velocities of various soil and rock types.


Presently, the CVM includes Cache, Weber/Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah basins. Future 
versions will expand the CVM to Tooele and Rush Valleys, Great Salt Lake Basin west 
of Antelope Island, and Wasatch Range back valleys.
